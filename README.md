# Quarto Beamer

The main goal of this repository is to complement the capabilities of Quarto when generating Beamer presentations. To achieve this, two TeX files are required: `before-body.tex` and `title.tex`. The former allows the inclusion of a short title and short author in the Madrid theme, as well as an ORCID for all themes. The latter file configures my personal Beamer settings. You can use it if you find it useful.
